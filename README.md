# Visualising-and-forecasting-stocks-using-Dash
Creating a stock dashboard which takes input of the stock name and gives details of the company with its logo. There is an option to select the time period to show stock prices based on that range. Along with this indicators can also be plotted in the graph and a predictive graph of a particular number of days can also be presented.
This project involves use of Python, Dash and ML.
